# Taskbar-Repair
I have always had problems with my taskbar not hiding while I am in a game so I set out to fix this. 
As I am new to python I used a lot of google and youtube to help get this running properly. I used Tkinter and the os packages so I could have a clean UI and be able to run cmd 
commands in python, so instead of restarting the explorer which was the taskbar in Task manager, I used commands to do it so now all I have to do is start the program and it fixes it so I don't have to use cmd or task manager. Then I used auto-py-to-exe which converted the .py file to .exe so anyone could run it.
